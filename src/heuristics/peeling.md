# Peeling Chain

Describes a specific transaction pattern, defined by a chain of one input and two outputs transactions. This pattern has been largely used by mixing services to obfuscate transactions [1] splitting outputs in smaller amounts to increase tracing. The heuristic considers the smaller output the change output because the the goal of this pattern is to proper "peel" a larger amount.
