# Getting started

[**bitgodine**](https://github.com/xn3cr0nx/bitgodine) is a new open source Bitcoin chain analysis platform, inspired from previous Politecnico di Milano's work, [Bitiodine](https://github.com/mikispag/bitiodine).
This work leverages previous work on chain analysis' heuristics to provide a new Bitcoinâ€™s flows tracing approach, based on probabilistic reliability of heuristics on secure basis heuristics.
In this way we provide a convenient platform to trace Bitcoin's flows specifying their probability and entities tagging.

In the following we will describe the required steps in order to setup and use the platform.
